### Features
- The original ui remains unchanged, can be enhanced in many ways.
- The original functionality remains unchanged, can be enhanced in many ways.
    - why: did not changed original look and feel due to optimization test
- Search functionality can be fixed
    - why: ui contains not functional components
- Pagination can be introduced
    - why: large list loading index page

- Have to investigate the flexibility of optimizing GraphQL queries
    - why: single query returning several entities
- React bundle need to be optimized
    - why: it will increase loading time

### Testing
- Component tests samples added _(not 100% with coverage)_
- Integration tests need to be added
- Reducers tests need to be added
    - why: couldn't cover all the tests due to limited time
